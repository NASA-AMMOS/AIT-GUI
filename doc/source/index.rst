Welcome to the AMMOS Instrument Toolkit GUI documentation!
==========================================================

The AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (AIT) GUI provides a framework for building a custom website for realtime telemetry monitoring, commanding, and other MOS operations with only minimal HTML and configuration file changes. Built on top of the AIT Core libraries, AIT GUI provides web-development friendly access to the underlying telemetry, commanding, EVR, system logging, and other AIT Core functions in addition to a suite of pre-built UI Components and a REST API to handle common MOS use cases.
